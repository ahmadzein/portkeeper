# Port Manager - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Executive Summary
Port Manager is a developer productivity tool that provides both CLI and GUI interfaces for managing local development ports. It solves the common problem of port conflicts by allowing developers to reserve, monitor, and manage ports across projects.

## Vision Statement
To become the go-to solution for developers who manage multiple projects, eliminating port conflicts and improving development workflow efficiency.

## Target Users
- Individual developers working on multiple projects
- Development teams sharing port conventions
- DevOps engineers managing local environments
- Full-stack developers juggling frontend/backend services

## Core Features

### CLI Features
1. **Port Checking**: `portman check <port>` - Check if port is reserved/in use
2. **Port Reservation**: `portman reserve <port> --name <project> --desc <description>`
3. **Port Listing**: `portman list` - Show all ports with status
4. **Port Release**: `portman release <port> [ports...]`
5. **Process Killing**: `portman kill <port> [ports...]`
6. **Port Scanning**: `portman scan` - Auto-detect ports in use
7. **Export/Import**: `portman export/import` - Share configurations

### GUI Features
1. **Dashboard View**: Visual table of all ports
2. **Search & Filter**: Find ports by number, project, status
3. **Quick Actions**: Release, edit, kill processes via buttons
4. **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded status (in-use, reserved, free)
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live sync with CLI operations
6. **Dark/Light Theme**: User preference support
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user efficiency

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **CLI**: Node.js with Commander.js or Rust with Clap
- **GUI**: Electron with React/Vue or Tauri with React
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage
- **IPC**: JSON-RPC for CLI-GUI communication
- **Testing**: Jest/Mocha for Node.js, or cargo test for Rust
- **Build**: Webpack/Vite for frontend, pkg/nexe for CLI

### Data Model
```json
{
  "port": 3000,
  "project_name": "my-app",
  "description": "React development server",
  "status": "reserved|in-use|free",
  "pid": 12345,
  "reserved_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "last_used": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "tags": ["frontend", "react"],
  "auto_release": false
}
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up project structure
- Implement core data model
- Create SQLite database layer
- Basic CLI with check/reserve/list commands
- Unit test framework

### Phase 2: CLI Complete (Week 3-4)
- Implement all CLI commands
- Add port scanning functionality
- Process management (kill command)
- Export/import functionality
- CLI testing and documentation

### Phase 3: GUI Development (Week 5-6)
- Set up Electron/Tauri project
- Create main dashboard view
- Implement CRUD operations
- Add search and filtering
- Real-time sync with CLI

### Phase 4: Enhancement (Week 7-8)
- Dark/light theme support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Advanced filtering
- Performance optimization
- Cross-platform testing

### Phase 5: Polish & Release (Week 9-10)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Installation packages
- CI/CD pipeline
- Marketing website
- Launch preparation

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: 1,000 downloads in first month
- **Engagement**: 50% weekly active users
- **Quality**: <5 critical bugs post-launch
- **Performance**: <100ms response time
- **Community**: 100 GitHub stars in 3 months

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Mitigate with thorough testing
- **Port scanning accuracy**: Use multiple detection methods
- **Data corruption**: Implement backup/recovery

### Market Risks
- **Low adoption**: Strong marketing and community engagement
- **Competition**: Unique features and better UX
- **Maintenance burden**: Clean architecture and automation

## Budget Considerations
- **Development Time**: 10 weeks (400 hours)
- **Tools & Services**: $500 (signing certificates, hosting)
- **Marketing**: $1,000 (content creation, ads)
- **Total**: ~$1,500 + time investment

## Go-to-Market Strategy
1. **Soft Launch**: Beta with developer communities
2. **Content Marketing**: Blog posts, tutorials
3. **Community**: GitHub, Reddit, Dev.to presence
4. **Partnerships**: Integration with popular dev tools
5. **Open Source**: MIT license for adoption

## Long-term Roadmap
- **v1.0**: Core features (CLI + GUI)
- **v1.5**: Team collaboration features
- **v2.0**: Cloud sync and backup
- **v2.5**: IDE integrations
- **v3.0**: Container/Docker support

## Team Assignments
