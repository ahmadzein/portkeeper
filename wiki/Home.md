## üí° Why Port Keeper?

Managing ports during development can be challenging:
- **Port Conflicts**: Multiple projects competing for the same ports
- **Team Coordination**: Different developers using different ports
- **Process Management**: Orphaned processes blocking ports
- **Documentation**: No central record of port assignments

Port Keeper solves these problems by providing a centralized port management system with both CLI and GUI interfaces.
