# Team Meeting #008: Comprehensive Update
**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Type**: Feature Enhancement & Documentation Overhaul
**Priority**: High

## Meeting Agenda

### 1. Active Ports Enhancement
**Objective**: Enhance the Active Ports view in GUI to show title and description for reserved ports

**Current State**: 
- ScanView shows: Port, PID, Process, State, Address
- No cross-reference with reserved ports database

**Required Changes**:
- Modify `scanActivePorts()` to include reservation details
- Update ActivePort interface to include title/description
- Enhance GUI table to display reservation information

### 2. Feature Parity Audit
**Objective**: Ensure CLI and GUI have exactly the same features

**Action Items**:
- Create feature comparison matrix
- Identify any missing features
- Implement missing features in either CLI or GUI

### 3. Documentation Overhaul
**Objective**: Comprehensive documentation update

**Tasks**:
- Fix all existing documentation
- Add detailed examples for all commands
- Improve help sections with real-world use cases
- Create consistent format across all docs

### 4. Team Expansion
**Status**: Technical Writer role already exists
**Location**: `/roles/technical-writer.md`
**Action**: Activate role for documentation tasks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Active Ports Enhancement (Priority 1)
1. Update `ActivePort` interface to include reservation details
2. Modify `PortService.scanActivePorts()` to cross-reference with database
3. Update GUI ScanView to display new information
4. Test enhancement thoroughly

### Phase 2: Feature Parity Audit (Priority 2)
1. Create comprehensive feature list for CLI
2. Create comprehensive feature list for GUI
3. Generate comparison matrix
4. Implement missing features

### Phase 3: Documentation Overhaul (Priority 3)
1. Audit all existing documentation
2. Fix inconsistencies and errors
3. Add examples to all command references
4. Create real-world use case scenarios

## Technical Implementation Details

### Active Ports Enhancement

**Modified ActivePort Interface**:
```typescript
interface ActivePort {
  number: number;
  pid?: number;
  processName?: string;
  state: string;
  address?: string;
  // New fields for reservation info
  projectName?: string;
  description?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  reservedAt?: Date;
}
```

**Cross-Reference Logic**:
1. Scan active ports using existing logic
2. For each active port, query database for reservation
3. Merge reservation details into ActivePort object
4. Return enhanced data to GUI
