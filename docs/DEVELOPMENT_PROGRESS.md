## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### GUI Stack Rationale:
1. **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop app with native capabilities
2. **React**: Component-based UI with excellent ecosystem
3. **Ant Design**: Professional UI components, rapid development
4. **Zustand**: Lightweight state management, perfect for our needs
5. **Electron Vite**: Fast HMR, optimized builds

### Security Measures:
- Context isolation enabled
- No direct Node.js access in renderer
- Validated IPC communication
- CSP headers configured
