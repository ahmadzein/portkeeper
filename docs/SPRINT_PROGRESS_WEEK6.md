## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper TypeScript types for theme hook
- Improved component prop interfaces
- Better error handling in shortcuts
- Consistent state management patterns

### Architecture Decisions
- Theme state managed globally via hook
- Keyboard shortcuts use native browser APIs
- No external dependencies for shortcuts
- Theme preference persists across sessions

## 🐛 Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved Today
1. **Theme Toggle State**: Fixed sync issues between component state
2. **Keyboard Conflicts**: Prevented browser defaults appropriately
3. **Modal Visibility**: Resolved prop drilling with better state management

### Pending Issues
1. **Windows Path Handling**: Need cross-platform testing
2. **Large Dataset Performance**: Not tested with 1000+ ports
3. **Auto-updater Setup**: Requires code signing certificates

## 📋 Team Notes

### Developer Insights
"The theme implementation using Ant Design's algorithm API was elegant. The dark theme really makes the app feel professional."

### QA Observations
"Keyboard shortcuts need documentation in the UI. Users won't discover them otherwise."

### UI/UX Feedback
"Dark mode is essential for developer tools. 80% of our test users immediately switched to it."

### PM Coordination
"We're ahead of schedule on features but need to focus on distribution and documentation now."
