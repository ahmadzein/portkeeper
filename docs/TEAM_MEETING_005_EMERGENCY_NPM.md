## üî• Emergency Action Plan

### DevOps Lead Report
**Status**: NOT PUBLISHED TO NPM ‚ùå

"We've been testing locally with `npm link`. We need to actually publish to npm registry before users can install!"

**Required Steps**:
1. Check package name availability
2. Create npm account/org
3. Run npm publish
4. Verify installation works

### Team Lead Analysis
"This is a showstopper. We can't launch without npm publishing. Let me check if 'portmanager' is available."

```bash
# Check npm availability
npm view portmanager

# Result: Package name might be taken!
# Alternative names:
# - @portmanager/cli
# - port-manager-cli
# - portman-cli
# - devport-manager
```

---

## üìù npm Publishing Checklist

### 1. Pre-publish Verification
```bash
# Check current directory
cd /Users/ahmadzein/github/portManager

# Verify package.json
cat package.json | grep -E '"name"|"version"'

# Check what will be published
npm pack --dry-run

# Run tests one more time
npm test
```

### 2. Package Name Decision
**PM Emergency Vote**: "We need to decide NOW!"

Options:
1. `portmanager` - Might be taken
2. `@portmanager/cli` - Scoped package
3. `port-manager-cli` - Hyphenated
4. `portman-cli` - Short version
5. `devport-manager` - Descriptive

**Team Decision**: Check availability in order, use first available

### 3. Publishing Process
```bash
# Login to npm (need account first!)
npm login

# Update package.json if name changed
npm version 1.0.0

# Publish publicly
npm publish --access public

# Verify it worked
npm info <package-name>
```
