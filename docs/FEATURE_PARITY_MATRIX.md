## Missing Features

### GUI Missing Features
None identified - GUI now has full feature parity with CLI

### CLI Missing Features
None identified - CLI has all core features

## Feature Parity Status
✅ **Complete**: Both CLI and GUI have achieved full feature parity as of 2025-07-26

## Feature Enhancement Opportunities

### Both CLI and GUI Could Add
1. **Bulk Operations**
   - Select multiple ports for release
   - Batch import/export options
   
2. **Port Groups**
   - Group related ports together
   - Manage groups as units

3. **Port History**
   - Track port usage over time
   - Show last used timestamps

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by date ranges
   - Filter by port ranges
   - Combined filters

## Implementation Priority

### Completed (Week 1)
1. ✅ Active Ports Enhancement - Shows reservation details
2. ✅ Kill Process in GUI - Added to Scan View with confirmation

### Current Focus (Week 2)
1. Documentation overhaul
2. Comprehensive testing of all features
3. Performance optimization

### Long-term (Future)
1. Bulk operations
2. Port groups
3. Usage analytics

## Testing Checklist

### CLI Testing
- [ ] All commands work as documented
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility

### GUI Testing
- [ ] All modals function correctly
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Dark/light theme consistency
- [ ] Responsive design

### Integration Testing
- [ ] CLI can launch GUI successfully
- [ ] Data consistency between interfaces
- [ ] Concurrent usage scenarios
- [ ] Database integrity

## Notes

1. **Active Ports Enhancement**: Successfully implemented cross-referencing with database to show reservation details in GUI scan view.

2. **Kill Process Feature**: This is the only significant feature gap. The CLI can kill processes on ports, but the GUI lacks this functionality.

3. **Search Capabilities**: The GUI has more advanced search capabilities than CLI, which is acceptable as GUIs typically offer richer interaction models.

4. **Data Formats**: Both CLI and GUI use the same JSON format for import/export, ensuring compatibility.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Implement kill process functionality in GUI Scan View
2. **Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect enhanced Active Ports view
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all features in both interfaces
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on feature priorities for future enhancements
